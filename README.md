When skimming a new repository, I'm always curious how much time went into creating it. I built Man Hours to generate and display a shields.io badge for your README with an estimate of how many hours committers have spent working on your files. You can see a sample badge above with the total hours put into this repo.

## How to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the project: logging bugs, submitting pull requests, reporting issues, and creating suggestions.

Even if you with push rights on the repository, you should create a personal fork and create feature branches there when you need them. This keeps the main repository clean and your workflow cruft out of sight.

We're also interested in your feedback on the future of this project. You can submit a suggestion or feature request through the issue tracker. To make this process more effective, we're asking that these include more information to help define them more clearly.
